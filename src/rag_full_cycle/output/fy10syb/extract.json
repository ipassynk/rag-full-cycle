    "text": "Immigration Courts:\nTotal Matters Received and Completed\nAn alien charged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with a violation\nof immigration law is issued a charging document. The most common charging\ndocuments are the Notice to Appear (NTA) and the Notice of Referral to immigration\njudge. When the charging document is filed by DHS with the immigration court,\njurisdiction over the case transfers from DHS to the Executive Office for Immigration\nReview (EOIR), which has oversight over the immigration courts located throughout the\nUnited States. Once an alien has been ordered removed by EOIR, DHS carries out the\nremoval. EOIR does not maintain statistics on alien removals from the United States.\nDuring court proceedings, aliens appear before an immigration judge and either\ncontest or concede the charges against them. In some instances, the immigration judge\nadjourns the case and sets a continuance date; for example, the judge may allow the\nalien time to obtain representation or to file an application for relief. After hearing a\ncase, the immigration judge renders a decision. The immigration judge may order the\nalien removed, or may grant relief such as cancellation of removal, asylum, adjustment\nof status, etc. If the immigration judge decides that removability has not been\nestablished by DHS, he or she may terminate the proceedings.\nIn addition to proceedings, immigration judges consider other matters such as\nbonds and motions.\n\u2022 Bond redetermination hearings are held when an alien in custody seeks\nrelease on his or her own recognizance, or seeks a reduction in the amount of\nbond. In some cases, bond redetermination hearings are held before EOIR\nreceives the charging document from DHS. During bond redetermination\nhearings, the judge may decide to lower, raise, maintain, or eliminate the\nbond amount set by DHS, or to change bond conditions.\n\u2022 Either the alien or DHS may request by motion that a case previously heard\nby an immigration judge be reopened or reconsidered. Generally, aliens or\nDHS file motions to reopen or reconsider because of changed circumstances.\nFor the purposes of this Year Book, the term \u201cimmigration court matters\u201d includes\nproceedings (deportation, exclusion, removal, credible fear, reasonable fear, claimed\nstatus, asylum only, rescission, continued detention review, Nicaraguan Adjustment and\nCentral American Relief Act (NACARA), and withholding only), bond redeterminations,\nand motions to reopen or reconsider. Receipts are defined as the total number of\nproceedings, bond redeterminations, and motions to reopen or reconsider received by\nthe immigration courts during the reporting period. Completions include immigration\njudge decisions on proceedings, bond redeterminations, motions, and other\ncompletions such as administrative closings and changes of venue.\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book January 2011\nB1"

    "text": "Immigration Courts:\nProceedings Received and Completed by Type\nThis section of the Statistical Year Book provides further details on proceedings\nby type. As noted in Tab B, proceedings, motions, and bond redeterminations make up\nthe various types of matters considered by the immigration courts.\nUntil April 1, 1997, the two major types of proceedings conducted by immigration\ncourts were exclusion proceedings and deportation proceedings. Individuals charged\nby the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) (now reorganized under\nDHS) as excludable were placed in exclusion proceedings. Exclusion cases generally\ninvolved a person who tried to enter the United States, but was stopped at the point of\nentry because INS found the person to be inadmissible. Deportation cases usually\narose when INS alleged that an alien had entered the country illegally, or had entered\nlegally, but then violated one or more conditions of his or her visa.\nProvisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (IIRIRA), which became effective on April 1, 1997, established five new types of\nproceedings:\n\u2022 Removal Proceedings. Under removal proceedings (which replaced\nexclusion and deportation proceedings), DHS must file a Notice to Appear\n(NTA) to initiate the proceedings.\n\u2022 Credible Fear Review. Arriving aliens with no documents or fraudulent\ndocuments are subject to expedited removal by DHS. If an arriving alien\nwho is subject to the expedited removal provisions expresses either an\nintention to apply for asylum or a fear of returning to the country of\nremoval, the alien is referred for a \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview by a DHS\nasylum officer. Aliens found by the asylum officer not to have a credible\nfear of persecution may request a review by an immigration judge. If the\njudge determines there is \u201ccredible fear,\u201d the judge will vacate the DHS\norder of expedited removal, and the alien will be placed in removal\nproceedings.\n\u2022 Reasonable Fear Review. DHS has the authority to order the\nadministrative removal of certain aggravated felons, and to reinstate\norders of removal for aliens previously removed. If an alien who has been\nordered administratively removed, or whose prior order of removal has\nbeen reinstated expresses a fear of returning to the country of removal, a\nDHS asylum officer makes a \u201creasonable fear\u201d determination. Aliens\nfound by the asylum officer not to have a reasonable fear of persecution\nmay request a review by an immigration judge. If the judge determines\nthere is \u201creasonable fear,\u201d the alien will be placed in withholding only\nproceedings.\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book January 2011\nC1"

    "text": "\u2022 Claimed Status Review. If an alien in expedited removal proceedings\nbefore DHS claims to be a U.S. citizen, to have been lawfully admitted for\npermanent residence, to have been admitted as a refugee, or to have\nbeen granted asylum, and DHS determines that the alien has no such\nclaim, he or she can obtain a review of that claim by an immigration judge.\n\u2022 Asylum-Only. An asylum only case is initiated when an arriving crewman\nor stowaway is not eligible to apply for admission into the United States,\nbut wants to request asylum. These proceedings also cover Visa Waiver\nProgram beneficiaries and individuals ordered removed from the United\nStates on security grounds.\nAdditional types of proceedings include:\n\u2022 Rescission. DHS issues a Notice of Intent to Rescind an individual\u2019s\npermanent resident status, and the individual has the right to contest the\ncharge before an immigration judge.\n\u2022 Continued Detention Review. In response to a United States Supreme\nCourt decision in Zadvydas v. Davis, a new type of proceeding was\nestablished regarding the continued detention of aliens who are subject to\nfinal orders of removal. In these cases the alien has already been ordered\nremoved, but DHS is unable to effect the removal (e.g., lack of a travel\ndocument, no diplomatic relations with the receiving country, etc.). The\nonly issue for the immigration judge to decide in Continued Detention\nReview cases is whether or not the alien should remain in custody.\n\u2022 NACARA. Certain aliens may apply for suspension of deportation or\ncancellation of removal under section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment\nand Central American Relief Act (NACARA).\n\u2022 Withholding Only. A previous removal/deportation/exclusion order has\nbeen reinstated by DHS or the alien has been ordered removed\n(administratively) by DHS (based upon a conviction for an aggravated\nfelony) and the alien expresses a fear of persecution or torture if returned\nto the country of removal and that claim is reviewed by an asylum officer.\nThe asylum officer has concluded that the alien has a reasonable fear of\npersecution or torture or an immigration judge conducted a Reasonable\nFear Review proceeding and found that \u201creasonable fear of persecution or\ntorture\u201d exists. The immigration judge\u2019s Reasonable Fear finding\nautomatically initiates a Withholding Only hearing.\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book January 2011\nC2"

An individual may\nask for a continuance of a proceeding to obtain counsel.\nAs shown in Figure 9, less than half of the aliens whose proceedings were\ncompleted during the period FY 2006 \u2013 FY 2010 were represented.

Further, in some instances, an alien with a pending asylum claim may\napply for and be granted another type of relief besides asylum, and this is also recorded\nas an \u201cother\u201d completion.\nFigure 16 provides the asylum grant rate for the past five years.

    "text": "Immigration Courts:\nExpedited Asylum Cases\nThere are two ways that aliens may request asylum: \u201caffirmatively,\u201d by\ncompleting an asylum application and filing it with a DHS Asylum Office; or\n\u201cdefensively,\u201d by requesting asylum before an immigration judge. Aliens who file\naffirmatively with DHS, but whose requests for asylum are not granted, are placed in\nremoval proceedings and referred to the appropriate immigration court for a hearing.\nAsylum regulations implemented in 1995 called for asylum applications to be\nprocessed within 180 days after filing. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 reiterated that time frame and calls for the\nadministrative adjudication of an asylum application within 180 days of the application\nfiling date, absent exceptional circumstances. This process is time sensitive because\nthe asylum applicant may not apply for employment authorization until 150 days after\nfiling, and DHS then has 30 days to grant or deny employment authorization. The\napplicant can only be granted employment authorization if the asylum application has\nnot been decided within 180 days of filing, provided there are no delays caused by the\nalien. Consequently, expedited processing of asylum applications occurs when (1) an\nalien files \u201caffirmatively\u201d at a DHS Asylum Office and the application is referred to EOIR\nwithin 75 days of filing; or (2) an alien files an asylum application \u201cdefensively\u201d with\nEOIR.\nAs shown in Figure 20 below, expedited asylum cases have decreased by 28\npercent from FY 2006 to FY 2010. Total asylum receipts have decreased by 42 percent\nfrom FY 2006 to FY 2010.\nFigure 20\nExpedited Asylum Receipts Compared to\nTotal Asylum Receipts\nExpedited Asylum Receipts\nFY 06 Number of Expedited Total Asylum\nAsylum Receipts Receipts\nFY 07 FY 06 35,391 56,969\nFY 07 31,688 57,515\nFY 08\nFY 08 29,952 47,442\nFY 09 30,846 44,022\nFY 09\nFY 10 25,401 32,961\nFY 10\n0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000\nTotal Asylum Receipts Number of Expedited Asylum Receipts\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book L1 January 2011"

    "text": "Immigration Courts:\nConvention Against Torture\nIn 1999, the Department of Justice implemented regulations regarding the United\nNations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment\nor Punishment (Convention Against Torture or CAT). Under these regulations, aliens in\nremoval, deportation, or exclusion proceedings may claim that they \u201cmore likely than\nnot\u201d will be tortured if removed from the United States. The regulation provides\njurisdiction to the immigration courts to hear these claims, and provides jurisdiction to\nthe BIA to hear appeals from the immigration courts\u2019 decisions regarding CAT claims.\nThere are two forms of protection under the 1999 regulations:\n\u2022 The regulation established a new form of withholding of removal which is\ngranted to an alien who establishes that he or she would be tortured in the\nproposed country of removal.\n\u2022 The second protection concerns aliens who would be tortured in the country\nof removal, but who are barred from withholding of removal. These aliens\nmay be granted deferral of removal, a form of protection that is more easily\nand quickly terminated if it becomes possible to remove the alien.\nAs shown in Table 9 below, the immigration courts adjudicated 24,754 CAT\napplications during FY 2010. Of those, 489 CAT cases were granted, the majority of\nwhich were granted withholding.\nTable 9 - FY 2010 Convention Against Torture Cases by Disposition\nGranted\nDenied Other Withdrawn Abandoned Total\nWithholding Deferral Total\n395 94 489 9,082 8,501 5,877 805 24,754\nTable 10 on the following page shows a breakdown of CAT completions by\nimmigration courts.

    "text": "Immigration Courts:\nImmigration Judge Grants of Voluntary Departure\nUnder certain circumstances, an immigration judge may allow an alien to depart\nthe United States voluntarily. An alien allowed to depart voluntarily concedes\nremovability, but is not barred from future re-entry. Failure to depart within the time\ngranted subjects the alien to a fine, and makes the alien ineligible for voluntary\ndeparture and several forms of relief for a ten-year period.\nPrior to the completion of proceedings, aliens may request voluntary departure\nin lieu of removal. The immigration judge has discretion to grant up to 120 days for the\nalien to depart voluntarily if the alien is able to pay for his or her removal, and if he or\nshe is not removable as an aggravated felon or a terrorist.\nImmigration judges also have discretion in certain cases to grant voluntary\ndeparture in lieu of removal at the conclusion of proceedings. If the judge finds that the\nalien has been present in the United States for one year immediately preceding the\nissuance of the Notice to Appear, has been a person of good moral character for the\npast five years, is not removable under aggravated felony or terrorist grounds, and has\nthe means to depart the United States and intends to do so, the immigration judge may\ngrant up to 60 days for the alien to depart voluntarily. Aliens allowed to depart\nvoluntarily are not barred from re-entry.\nVoluntary departure is considered a form of removal, not a type of relief.\nImmigration judge decisions on proceedings (as discussed in Tab D) include grants of\nvoluntary departure under removal. Table 14 shows the percentage of removal orders\nthat are grants of voluntary departure.\nTable 14 - IJ Removal Decisions Compared to Voluntary Departure Decisions\nTotal Removal Voluntary Departure Percent Voluntary\nDecisions Decisions Departure Decisions\nFY 06 222,211 22,212 10%\nFY 07 170,291 23,971 14%\nFY 08 182,720 26,684 15%\nFY 09 185,410 26,878 14%\nFY 10 166,424 27,560 17%\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book January 2011\nQ1"

    "text": "Immigration Courts:\nApplications for Relief other than Asylum\nAlthough asylum is the most common form of relief requested before an\nimmigration judge, other forms of relief are also granted to eligible aliens. (See Tabs I-L\nfor information on asylum, and Tab M for information on protection granted under the\nConvention Against Torture.)\nThis tab describes other forms of relief such as adjustment of status; suspension\nand cancellation; and Section 212(c) relief. The Illegal Immigration Reform and\nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) provided a new form of relief called\ncancellation of removal. Cancellation of removal was intended to replace the former\nImmigration and Nationality Act Section 212(c) waiver and suspension of deportation.\nTable 15 on page R3 provides information on relief granted under the following\nprovisions.\n\u2022 Adjustment of Status is a type of relief from deportation, removal, or exclusion, for\nan alien who is eligible for lawful permanent resident status based on a visa\npetition approved by DHS. Normally, the visa petition has been filed by a United\nStates citizen spouse.\n\u2022 Prior to the passage of IIRIRA, Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality\nAct provided relief from deportation for long-term lawful permanent residents who\nhad committed a crime. In order to be eligible to apply for 212(c) relief, an\napplicant had to show that he or she had been a lawful permanent resident for at\nleast seven years, had served less than five years of a sentence if the underlying\ncrime was classified as an aggravated felony, had been rehabilitated, and had no\nother criminal record. If an applicant in exclusion or deportation proceedings is\nable to establish these factors, the immigration judge has discretion to grant relief\nunder 212(c).\n\u2022 Suspension of Deportation is another pre-IIRIRA form of discretionary relief.\nCertain aliens in deportation proceedings who have maintained continuous\nphysical presence in the United States for specific periods of time, and have met\nthe other statutory requirements may be granted suspension of deportation and\nadjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident. The total number of\nadjustments to lawful permanent resident status under suspension of deportation\nor cancellation of removal is limited to a 4,000 annual cap under IIRIRA.\nApplicants for suspension of deportation who applied for this relief prior to the\nimplementation of IIRIRA, or who meet certain conditions of the Nicaraguan\nAdjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) are not subject to the\ncap.\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book R1 January 2011"

    "text": "\u2022 As noted above, Cancellation of Removal is a form of relief provided by IIRIRA.\nThere are two IIRIRA provisions addressing cancellation of removal:\n\u2022 Permanent Residents. Under the first provision, a lawful permanent\nresident facing removal on criminal grounds who has been lawfully\nadmitted for permanent residence for at least five years, and who has\nresided continuously in the United States for seven years after a lawful\nadmission may request cancellation, provided he or she has no aggravated\nfelony convictions.\n\u2022 Non-Permanent Residents. Under the second provision, applicants\nphysically present in the United States for a continuous period of 10 years\nwho have not been convicted of a criminal offense may seek cancellation\nof removal and adjustment of status to permanent resident alien.

The alien\u2019s\nremoval is deferred only to the country in which it has been determined that the alien is\nlikely to be tortured. However, the alien may be removed at any time to another country\nwhere he or she is not likely to be tortured. In addition, deferral of removal is effective\nonly until it is terminated.

Deportation cases also occurred when INS alleged that a\nrespondent entered the country legally with a visa but then violated one or more\nconditions of the visa. When INS became aware of a respondent believed to be\ndeportable, they issued a charging document called an Order to Show Cause (OSC).\nAn OSC is the charging document that was used prior to April 1, 1997. A deportation\nproceeding actually began when the OSC was filed with an immigration court. In such\nproceedings, the government, represented by INS, had to prove that a respondent was\ndeportable for the reasons stated in the OSC.

The INS District Director could either detain the applicant or \"parole\"\nthe applicant into the country; i.e., release from detention and allow to remain free until\ncompletion of the hearing. In either case, the applicant technically had not entered the\ncountry as a matter of law. Beginning April 1, 1997, deportation and exclusion\nproceedings were replaced by removal proceedings. Contrast Deportation and\nRemoval Proceedings.\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR)\nThe Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) was created on January 9, 1983,\nthrough an internal Department of Justice (DOJ) reorganization which combined the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals with the immigration judge function, which was previously\nperformed by Special Inquiry Officers of the former Immigration and Naturalization\nService (INS) (now Department of Homeland Security). The Office of the Chief\nAdministrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO) was added in 1987. EOIR is responsible for\nadjudicating immigration cases. Specifically, under delegated authority from the\nAttorney General, EOIR interprets and administers federal immigration laws by\nconducting immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative\nhearings. EOIR consists of three components: the Office of the Chief Immigration\nJudge, which is responsible for managing the numerous immigration courts located\nthroughout the United States where immigration judges adjudicate individual cases; the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals, which primarily conducts appellate reviews of\nimmigration judge decisions; and the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer,\nwhich adjudicates certain immigration-related civil money penalty and document fraud\ncases. EOIR is committed to providing fair, expeditious, and uniform application of the\nnation's immigration laws in all cases.\nExpedited Asylum\nAsylum regulations implemented in 1995 mandated that asylum applications be\nprocessed within 180 days after filing either at a Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Asylum Office or at an immigration\ncourt. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA)\nreiterated the 180-day rule. Consequently, expedited processing of asylum applications\noccurs when (1) an alien files \u201caffirmatively\u201d at an Asylum Office on or after January 4,\n1995, and the application is referred to the Executive Office for Immigration Review\n(EOIR) by DHS within 75 days of the filing; or (2) an alien files an application\n\u201cdefensively\u201d with EOIR on or after January 4, 1995.\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book Appendix A - Glossary of Terms\nJanuary 2011\n10"

As amended, the Immigration and Nationality Act provides the\nfoundation for immigration law in effect today. The Immigration and Nationality Act\ndeals with the immigration, temporary admission, naturalization, and removal of aliens.\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\nUntil its transition to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on March 1, 2003,\nINS was the agency responsible for administering immigration and nationality laws\nrelating to the temporary admission, immigration, naturalization, and removal of aliens.\nSpecifically, INS inspected aliens to determine their admissibility into the United States,\nadjudicated requests of aliens for benefits under the law, guarded against illegal entry\ninto the United States, removed aliens in this country who were in violation of the law,\nexamined alien applicants seeking to become citizens, and enforced immigration-related\nemployment verification and document fraud laws. See Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\nImmigration Court\nEach immigration court is staffed with one or more immigration judges who conduct\nimmigration hearings. An administrative control immigration court is one that creates\nand maintains Records of Proceedings for immigration courts within an assigned\ngeographical area. Management functions of the immigration court are supervised by a\nCourt Administrator.\nImmigration Judge\nThe term immigration judge means an attorney whom the Attorney General appoints as\nan administrative judge within the Executive Office for Immigration Review, Office of the\nChief Immigration Judge, qualified to conduct specified classes of proceedings,\nincluding exclusion, deportation, removal, asylum, bond redetermination, rescission,\nwithholding, credible fear, reasonable fear, and claimed status review. Immigration\njudges act as the Attorney General\u2019s delegates in deciding the matters before them and\nexercise the powers and duties delegated to them by the Immigration and Nationality\nAct and by the Attorney General through regulation. Immigration judge decisions are\nadministratively final unless appealed or certified to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\nImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA)\nAmong other things, IRCA addressed the problem of undocumented aliens by imposing\nsanctions on employers who hired or continued to employ them, and legalizing the\nstatus of certain undocumented entrants who had arrived prior to January 1, 1982. The\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (now Department of Homeland Security) also\nwas provided with significant new resources to enforce the immigration laws through\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book Appendix A - Glossary of Terms\nJanuary 2011\n12"

Aliens who, at the time of entry, are within one of these classes\nof inadmissible aliens are removable.\nInstitutional Hearing Program (IHP)\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 requires the Attorney General to\nexpeditiously commence immigration proceedings for alien inmates convicted of crimes\nin the United States. To meet this requirement, the Department of Justice established\nthe IHP where removal hearings are held inside correctional institutions prior to the alien\ncompleting his or her criminal sentence. The IHP is a collaborative effort between the\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review and the Department of Homeland Security and\nvarious federal, state, and local corrections agencies throughout the country.\nInterlocutory Appeals\nAn interlocutory appeal is an appeal taken to the Board of Immigration Appeals from a\npreliminary ruling of an immigration judge before the judge renders a final decision in\nthe case.

A removal case usually arises when the Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS) alleges that a respondent is inadmissible to the United States, has\nentered the country illegally by crossing the border without being inspected by an\nimmigration officer, or has violated the terms of his or her admission.

If, within five years of granting adjustment of status, the Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS) discovers that the respondent/applicant was not entitled to\nlawful permanent resident (LPR) status when it was granted, DHS issues a Notice of\nIntent to Rescind. If the respondent/applicant requests a hearing before an immigration\ncourt, DHS will file the Notice with the immigration court, and the proceeding to rescind\nthe individual's LPR status commences. As with deportation cases, the government has\nthe burden of proof to show that rescission is warranted. If an individual loses LPR\nstatus, he or she then is usually subject to removal proceedings. Although rescission\nproceedings still exist after April 1, 1997, DHS may also place an LPR into removal\nproceedings. An order of removal is sufficient to rescind the alien's status.

See former section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Application for\nthis relief was made during the course of a hearing before an immigration judge. The\nstatus of an alien who was granted this relief was adjusted to that of an alien lawfully\nadmitted for permanent residence. In 1997, the Illegal Immigration Reform and\nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 replaced suspension of deportation with\ncancellation of removal. See Cancellation of Removal, Illegal Immigration Reform and\nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA).\nT\nTermination\nA termination is a type of completion in which a case is closed by an immigration judge\nor the Board of Immigration Appeals without a final order of removal or deportation.

An alien allowed to voluntarily depart concedes removability but is\nnot barred from seeking admission at a port of entry in the future. Failure to depart\nwithin the time granted results in a fine and a 10-year bar against the alien applying for\nseveral forms of relief from removal.\nW\nWithdrawal of an Appeal\nAn appealing party may, at any time prior to the entry of a decision by the Board of\nImmigration Appeals, voluntarily withdraw his or her appeal.
