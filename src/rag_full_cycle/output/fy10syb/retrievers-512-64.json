      "text": "Immigration Courts : Total Matters Received and Completed An alien charged by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) with a violation of immigration law is issued a charging document . The most common charging documents are the Notice to Appear ( NTA ) and the Notice of Referral to immigration judge . When the charging document is filed by DHS with the immigration court , jurisdiction over the case transfers from DHS to the Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) , which has oversight over the immigration courts located throughout the United States . Once an alien has been ordered removed by EOIR , DHS carries out the removal . EOIR does not maintain statistics on alien removals from the United States . During court proceedings , aliens appear before an immigration judge and either contest or concede the charges against them . In some instances , the immigration judge adjourns the case and sets a continuance date ; for example , the judge may allow the alien time to obtain representation or to file an application for relief . After hearing a case , the immigration judge renders a decision . The immigration judge may order the alien removed , or may grant relief such as cancellation of removal , asylum , adjustment of status , etc . If the immigration judge decides that removability has not been established by DHS , he or she may terminate the proceedings . In addition to proceedings , immigration judges consider other matters such as bonds and motions . \u2022 Bond redetermination hearings are held when an alien in custody seeks release on his or her own recognizance , or seeks a reduction in the amount of bond . In some cases , bond redetermination hearings are held before EOIR receives the charging document from DHS . During bond redetermination hearings , the judge may decide to lower , raise , maintain , or eliminate the bond amount set by DHS , or to change bond conditions . \u2022 Either the alien or DHS may request by motion that a case previously heard by an immigration judge be reopened or reconsidered . Generally , aliens or DHS file motions to reopen or reconsider because of changed circumstances . For the purposes of this Year Book , the term \u201c immigration court matters \u201d includes proceedings ( deportation , exclusion , removal , credible fear , reasonable fear , claimed status , asylum only , rescission , continued detention review , Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act ( NACARA ) , and withholding only ) , bond redeterminations , and motions to reopen or reconsider . Receipts are defined as the total number of proceedings , bond redeterminations , and motions to reopen or reconsider received by the immigration courts during the reporting period .

Additionally , some aliens are determined to be removable by the Department of Homeland Security , e.g. , in expedited removal or administrative removal proceedings . Only aliens found removable by the Executive Office for Immigration Review are reported in this Year Book . Removal Proceedings An immigration court proceeding begun on or after April 1 , 1997 , seeking to either stop certain aliens from being admitted to the United States or to remove them from the United States . A removal case usually arises when the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) alleges that a respondent is inadmissible to the United States , has entered the country illegally by crossing the border without being inspected by an immigration officer , or has violated the terms of his or her admission . The DHS issues a charging document called a Notice to Appear ( Form I-862 ) and files it with an immigration court to begin a removal proceeding . Reopen , Motion to Aliens may request , by motion , the reopening of a case previously heard by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals ( BIA ) . A motion to reopen asks an immigration judge or the BIA to consider new and previously unavailable facts or evidence in a case . Represented A represented individual has an attorney or accredited representative act as his agent in proceedings before the immigration courts or the Board of Immigration Appeals . Rescission Proceedings A less common type of proceeding is related to rescinding lawful permanent resident status . If , within five years of granting adjustment of status , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) discovers that the respondent/applicant was not entitled to lawful permanent resident ( LPR ) status when it was granted , DHS issues a Notice of Intent to Rescind . If the respondent/applicant requests a hearing before an immigration court , DHS will file the Notice with the immigration court , and the proceeding to rescind the individual 's LPR status commences . As with deportation cases , the government has the burden of proof to show that rescission is warranted . If an individual loses LPR status , he or she then is usually subject to removal proceedings . Although rescission proceedings still exist after April 1 , 1997 , DHS may also place an LPR into removal proceedings . An order of removal is sufficient to rescind the alien 's status . See Notice of Intent to Rescind . Respondent A party to an immigration proceeding against whom charges have been lodged and findings may be made .

      "text": "Immigration Courts : Expedited Asylum Cases There are two ways that aliens may request asylum : \u201c affirmatively , \u201d by completing an asylum application and filing it with a DHS Asylum Office ; or \u201c defensively , \u201d by requesting asylum before an immigration judge . Aliens who file affirmatively with DHS , but whose requests for asylum are not granted , are placed in removal proceedings and referred to the appropriate immigration court for a hearing . Asylum regulations implemented in 1995 called for asylum applications to be processed within 180 days after filing . The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act ( IIRIRA ) of 1996 reiterated that time frame and calls for the administrative adjudication of an asylum application within 180 days of the application filing date , absent exceptional circumstances . This process is time sensitive because the asylum applicant may not apply for employment authorization until 150 days after filing , and DHS then has 30 days to grant or deny employment authorization . The applicant can only be granted employment authorization if the asylum application has not been decided within 180 days of filing , provided there are no delays caused by the alien . Consequently , expedited processing of asylum applications occurs when ( 1 ) an alien files \u201c affirmatively \u201d at a DHS Asylum Office and the application is referred to EOIR within 75 days of filing ; or ( 2 ) an alien files an asylum application \u201c defensively \u201d with EOIR . As shown in Figure 20 below , expedited asylum cases have decreased by 28 percent from FY 2006 to FY 2010 . Total asylum receipts have decreased by 42 percent from FY 2006 to FY 2010 .
