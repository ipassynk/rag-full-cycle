    "text": "Immigration Courts : Total Matters Received and Completed An alien charged by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) with a violation of immigration law is issued a charging document . The most common charging documents are the Notice to Appear ( NTA ) and the Notice of Referral to immigration judge . When the charging document is filed by DHS with the immigration court , jurisdiction over the case transfers from DHS to the Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) , which has oversight over the immigration courts located throughout the United States . Once an alien has been ordered removed by EOIR , DHS carries out the removal . EOIR does not maintain statistics on alien removals from the United States . During court proceedings , aliens appear before an immigration judge and either contest or concede the charges against them . In some instances , the immigration judge adjourns the case and sets a continuance date ; for example , the judge may allow the alien time to obtain representation or to file an application for relief . After hearing a case , the immigration judge renders a decision . The immigration judge may order the alien removed , or may grant relief such as cancellation of removal , asylum , adjustment of status , etc . If the immigration judge decides that removability has not been established by DHS , he or she may terminate the proceedings . In addition to proceedings , immigration judges consider other matters such as bonds and motions . \u2022 Bond redetermination hearings are held when an alien in custody seeks release on his or her own recognizance , or seeks a reduction in the amount of bond . In some cases , bond redetermination hearings are held before EOIR receives the charging document from DHS . During bond redetermination hearings , the judge may decide to lower , raise , maintain , or eliminate the bond amount set by DHS , or to change bond conditions . \u2022 Either the alien or DHS may request by motion that a case previously heard by an immigration judge be reopened or reconsidered . Generally , aliens or DHS file motions to reopen or reconsider because of changed circumstances . For the purposes of this Year Book , the term \u201c immigration court matters \u201d includes proceedings ( deportation , exclusion , removal , credible fear , reasonable fear , claimed status , asylum only , rescission , continued detention review , Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act ( NACARA ) , and withholding only ) , bond redeterminations , and motions to reopen or reconsider . Receipts are defined as the total number of proceedings , bond redeterminations , and motions to reopen or reconsider received by the immigration courts during the reporting period . Completions include immigration judge decisions on proceedings , bond redeterminations , motions , and other completions such as administrative closings and changes of venue .

    "text": "Immigration Courts : Proceedings Received and Completed by Type This section of the Statistical Year Book provides further details on proceedings by type . As noted in Tab B , proceedings , motions , and bond redeterminations make up the various types of matters considered by the immigration courts . Until April 1 , 1997 , the two major types of proceedings conducted by immigration courts were exclusion proceedings and deportation proceedings . Individuals charged by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) ( now reorganized under DHS ) as excludable were placed in exclusion proceedings . Exclusion cases generally involved a person who tried to enter the United States , but was stopped at the point of entry because INS found the person to be inadmissible . Deportation cases usually arose when INS alleged that an alien had entered the country illegally , or had entered legally , but then violated one or more conditions of his or her visa . Provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) , which became effective on April 1 , 1997 , established five new types of proceedings : \u2022 Removal Proceedings . Under removal proceedings ( which replaced exclusion and deportation proceedings ) , DHS must file a Notice to Appear ( NTA ) to initiate the proceedings . \u2022 Credible Fear Review . Arriving aliens with no documents or fraudulent documents are subject to expedited removal by DHS . If an arriving alien who is subject to the expedited removal provisions expresses either an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of returning to the country of removal , the alien is referred for a \u201c credible fear \u201d interview by a DHS asylum officer . Aliens found by the asylum officer not to have a credible fear of persecution may request a review by an immigration judge . If the judge determines there is \u201c credible fear , \u201d the judge will vacate the DHS order of expedited removal , and the alien will be placed in removal proceedings . \u2022 Reasonable Fear Review . DHS has the authority to order the administrative removal of certain aggravated felons , and to reinstate orders of removal for aliens previously removed . If an alien who has been ordered administratively removed , or whose prior order of removal has been reinstated expresses a fear of returning to the country of removal , a DHS asylum officer makes a \u201c reasonable fear \u201d determination . Aliens found by the asylum officer not to have a reasonable fear of persecution may request a review by an immigration judge . If the judge determines there is \u201c reasonable fear , \u201d the alien will be placed in withholding only proceedings .

    "text": "\u2022 Claimed Status Review . If an alien in expedited removal proceedings before DHS claims to be a U.S. citizen , to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence , to have been admitted as a refugee , or to have been granted asylum , and DHS determines that the alien has no such claim , he or she can obtain a review of that claim by an immigration judge . \u2022 Asylum-Only . An asylum only case is initiated when an arriving crewman or stowaway is not eligible to apply for admission into the United States , but wants to request asylum . These proceedings also cover Visa Waiver Program beneficiaries and individuals ordered removed from the United States on security grounds . Additional types of proceedings include : \u2022 Rescission . DHS issues a Notice of Intent to Rescind an individual \u2019 s permanent resident status , and the individual has the right to contest the charge before an immigration judge . \u2022 Continued Detention Review . In response to a United States Supreme Court decision in Zadvydas v. Davis , a new type of proceeding was established regarding the continued detention of aliens who are subject to final orders of removal . In these cases the alien has already been ordered removed , but DHS is unable to effect the removal ( e.g. , lack of a travel document , no diplomatic relations with the receiving country , etc. ) . The only issue for the immigration judge to decide in Continued Detention Review cases is whether or not the alien should remain in custody . \u2022 NACARA . Certain aliens may apply for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal under section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act ( NACARA ) . \u2022 Withholding Only . A previous removal/deportation/exclusion order has been reinstated by DHS or the alien has been ordered removed ( administratively ) by DHS ( based upon a conviction for an aggravated felony ) and the alien expresses a fear of persecution or torture if returned to the country of removal and that claim is reviewed by an asylum officer .

The immigration judge must then decide whether to deny or grant an alien \u2019 s application for asylum . If the asylum applicant fails to appear for a scheduled court hearing , the application is considered abandoned . In other instances , the asylum applicant chooses to withdraw his or her application for asylum . EOIR tracks each of these possible outcomes as completed cases : grants , denials , withdrawals , and abandoned applications for asylum . A substantial number of closed cases do not fall into one of the four categories listed above , and are counted as \u201c other \u201d asylum completions , e.g. , change of venue to another court . Further , in some instances , an alien with a pending asylum claim may apply for and be granted another type of relief besides asylum , and this is also recorded as an \u201c other \u201d completion . Figure 16 provides the asylum grant rate for the past five years . The grant rate is calculated as a percentage of asylum claims decided on the merits , i.e. , grants and denials .

This form of protection fulfills the United States \u2019 treaty obligations as signatory to the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees ( 1967 Protocol ) .

    "text": "Immigration Courts : Expedited Asylum Cases There are two ways that aliens may request asylum : \u201c affirmatively , \u201d by completing an asylum application and filing it with a DHS Asylum Office ; or \u201c defensively , \u201d by requesting asylum before an immigration judge . Aliens who file affirmatively with DHS , but whose requests for asylum are not granted , are placed in removal proceedings and referred to the appropriate immigration court for a hearing . Asylum regulations implemented in 1995 called for asylum applications to be processed within 180 days after filing . The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act ( IIRIRA ) of 1996 reiterated that time frame and calls for the administrative adjudication of an asylum application within 180 days of the application filing date , absent exceptional circumstances . This process is time sensitive because the asylum applicant may not apply for employment authorization until 150 days after filing , and DHS then has 30 days to grant or deny employment authorization . The applicant can only be granted employment authorization if the asylum application has not been decided within 180 days of filing , provided there are no delays caused by the alien . Consequently , expedited processing of asylum applications occurs when ( 1 ) an alien files \u201c affirmatively \u201d at a DHS Asylum Office and the application is referred to EOIR within 75 days of filing ; or ( 2 ) an alien files an asylum application \u201c defensively \u201d with EOIR . As shown in Figure 20 below , expedited asylum cases have decreased by 28 percent from FY 2006 to FY 2010 . Total asylum receipts have decreased by 42 percent from FY 2006 to FY 2010 .

    "text": "Immigration Courts : Convention Against Torture In 1999 , the Department of Justice implemented regulations regarding the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( Convention Against Torture or CAT ) . Under these regulations , aliens in removal , deportation , or exclusion proceedings may claim that they \u201c more likely than not \u201d will be tortured if removed from the United States . The regulation provides jurisdiction to the immigration courts to hear these claims , and provides jurisdiction to the BIA to hear appeals from the immigration courts \u2019 decisions regarding CAT claims . There are two forms of protection under the 1999 regulations : \u2022 The regulation established a new form of withholding of removal which is granted to an alien who establishes that he or she would be tortured in the proposed country of removal . \u2022 The second protection concerns aliens who would be tortured in the country of removal , but who are barred from withholding of removal .

( See Tabs I-L for information on asylum , and Tab M for information on protection granted under the Convention Against Torture . ) This tab describes other forms of relief such as adjustment of status ; suspension and cancellation ; and Section 212 ( c ) relief . The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) provided a new form of relief called cancellation of removal . Cancellation of removal was intended to replace the former Immigration and Nationality Act Section 212 ( c ) waiver and suspension of deportation . Table 15 on page R3 provides information on relief granted under the following provisions . \u2022 Adjustment of Status is a type of relief from deportation , removal , or exclusion , for an alien who is eligible for lawful permanent resident status based on a visa petition approved by DHS . Normally , the visa petition has been filed by a United States citizen spouse . \u2022 Prior to the passage of IIRIRA , Section 212 ( c ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provided relief from deportation for long-term lawful permanent residents who had committed a crime . In order to be eligible to apply for 212 ( c ) relief , an applicant had to show that he or she had been a lawful permanent resident for at least seven years , had served less than five years of a sentence if the underlying crime was classified as an aggravated felony , had been rehabilitated , and had no other criminal record . If an applicant in exclusion or deportation proceedings is able to establish these factors , the immigration judge has discretion to grant relief under 212 ( c ) . \u2022 Suspension of Deportation is another pre-IIRIRA form of discretionary relief . Certain aliens in deportation proceedings who have maintained continuous physical presence in the United States for specific periods of time , and have met the other statutory requirements may be granted suspension of deportation and adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident . The total number of adjustments to lawful permanent resident status under suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal is limited to a 4,000 annual cap under IIRIRA . Applicants for suspension of deportation who applied for this relief prior to the implementation of IIRIRA , or who meet certain conditions of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act ( NACARA ) are not subject to the cap .

Under the first provision , a lawful permanent resident facing removal on criminal grounds who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for at least five years , and who has resided continuously in the United States for seven years after a lawful admission may request cancellation , provided he or she has no aggravated felony convictions . \u2022 Non-Permanent Residents . Under the second provision , applicants physically present in the United States for a continuous period of 10 years who have not been convicted of a criminal offense may seek cancellation of removal and adjustment of status to permanent resident alien . The applicant must demonstrate exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a citizen or lawful permanent resident alien spouse , parent , or child . IIRIRA limits to 4,000 annually the total number of adjustments to lawful permanent resident status under suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal . Applicants for cancellation of removal who meet certain conditions are not subject to the cap .

The regulation provides that venue may be changed only after one of the parties has filed a motion to change venue and the other party has been given notice and an opportunity to respond . Claimed Status Review If an alien in expedited removal proceedings claims under oath to be a U.S. citizen , to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence , to have been admitted as a refugee , or to have been granted asylum , and the Department of Homeland Security determines that the alien has no such claim , he or she can obtain a review of that claim by an immigration judge . Coercive Population Control The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) changed the definition of \u201c refugee \u201d to include , as a form of political opinion , those who have a well-founded fear of persecution or have suffered persecution on account of Coercive Population Control ( CPC ) policies . Previously , up to a total of 1,000 refugee admissions and asylum grants were made each fiscal year to applicants who raised claims based on CPC .

An alien who was eligible for a grant of asylum based on coercive population control methods received a grant conditioned on an administrative determination by the Department of Homeland Security that a number was available .

Convention Against Torture On March 22 , 1999 , the Department of Justice implemented regulations regarding the United Nations \u2019 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( Convention Against Torture or CAT ) . Under this regulation , aliens in removal , deportation , or exclusion proceedings may claim that they \u201c more likely than not \u201d will be tortured if removed from the United States and may apply for withholding of removal under CAT .

D Decision A determination and order arrived at after consideration of facts and law , by either an immigration judge , the Board of Immigration Appeals , or the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer . Defensive Asylum Application An asylum application initially filed with the immigration court after the alien has been put into proceedings to remove him or her from the United States . Contrast Affirmative Asylum Application . Deferral of Removal If an immigration judge concludes that it is more likely than not that a removable alien will be tortured in a country , but the alien is ineligible for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture ( CAT ) , the alien \u2019 s removal will be deferred . The alien \u2019 s removal is deferred only to the country in which it has been determined that the alien is likely to be tortured . However , the alien may be removed at any time to another country where he or she is not likely to be tortured . In addition , deferral of removal is effective only until it is terminated .

    "text": "Deportation Proceedings Prior to April 1 , 1997 , a deportation case usually arose when the former Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) ( now Department of Homeland Security ) alleged that a respondent entered the country illegally by crossing the border without being inspected by an immigration officer . Deportation cases also occurred when INS alleged that a respondent entered the country legally with a visa but then violated one or more conditions of the visa . When INS became aware of a respondent believed to be deportable , they issued a charging document called an Order to Show Cause ( OSC ) . An OSC is the charging document that was used prior to April 1 , 1997 . A deportation proceeding actually began when the OSC was filed with an immigration court . In such proceedings , the government , represented by INS , had to prove that a respondent was deportable for the reasons stated in the OSC . As of April 1 , 1997 , deportation and exclusion proceedings were replaced by removal proceedings . Contrast Exclusion and Removal Proceedings . Detained The Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) maintains data on the custody status of aliens in proceedings .

The INS District Director could either detain the applicant or `` parole '' the applicant into the country ; i.e. , release from detention and allow to remain free until completion of the hearing . In either case , the applicant technically had not entered the country as a matter of law . Beginning April 1 , 1997 , deportation and exclusion proceedings were replaced by removal proceedings . Contrast Deportation and Removal Proceedings . Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) The Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) was created on January 9 , 1983 , through an internal Department of Justice ( DOJ ) reorganization which combined the Board of Immigration Appeals with the immigration judge function , which was previously performed by Special Inquiry Officers of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) ( now Department of Homeland Security ) . The Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer ( OCAHO ) was added in 1987 . EOIR is responsible for adjudicating immigration cases . Specifically , under delegated authority from the Attorney General , EOIR interprets and administers federal immigration laws by conducting immigration court proceedings , appellate reviews , and administrative hearings . EOIR consists of three components : the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge , which is responsible for managing the numerous immigration courts located throughout the United States where immigration judges adjudicate individual cases ; the Board of Immigration Appeals , which primarily conducts appellate reviews of immigration judge decisions ; and the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer , which adjudicates certain immigration-related civil money penalty and document fraud cases . EOIR is committed to providing fair , expeditious , and uniform application of the nation 's immigration laws in all cases . Expedited Asylum Asylum regulations implemented in 1995 mandated that asylum applications be processed within 180 days after filing either at a Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , Asylum Office or at an immigration court . The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) reiterated the 180-day rule . Consequently , expedited processing of asylum applications occurs when ( 1 ) an alien files \u201c affirmatively \u201d at an Asylum Office on or after January 4 , 1995 , and the application is referred to the Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) by DHS within 75 days of the filing ; or ( 2 ) an alien files an application \u201c defensively \u201d with EOIR on or after January 4 , 1995 .

The Immigration and Nationality Act deals with the immigration , temporary admission , naturalization , and removal of aliens . Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) Until its transition to the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) on March 1 , 2003 , INS was the agency responsible for administering immigration and nationality laws relating to the temporary admission , immigration , naturalization , and removal of aliens . Specifically , INS inspected aliens to determine their admissibility into the United States , adjudicated requests of aliens for benefits under the law , guarded against illegal entry into the United States , removed aliens in this country who were in violation of the law , examined alien applicants seeking to become citizens , and enforced immigration-related employment verification and document fraud laws .

Removal Proceedings An immigration court proceeding begun on or after April 1 , 1997 , seeking to either stop certain aliens from being admitted to the United States or to remove them from the United States .

Reopen , Motion to Aliens may request , by motion , the reopening of a case previously heard by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals ( BIA ) . A motion to reopen asks an immigration judge or the BIA to consider new and previously unavailable facts or evidence in a case . Represented A represented individual has an attorney or accredited representative act as his agent in proceedings before the immigration courts or the Board of Immigration Appeals . Rescission Proceedings A less common type of proceeding is related to rescinding lawful permanent resident status . If , within five years of granting adjustment of status , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) discovers that the respondent/applicant was not entitled to lawful permanent resident ( LPR ) status when it was granted , DHS issues a Notice of Intent to Rescind . If the respondent/applicant requests a hearing before an immigration court , DHS will file the Notice with the immigration court , and the proceeding to rescind the individual 's LPR status commences . As with deportation cases , the government has the burden of proof to show that rescission is warranted . If an individual loses LPR status , he or she then is usually subject to removal proceedings . Although rescission proceedings still exist after April 1 , 1997 , DHS may also place an LPR into removal proceedings . An order of removal is sufficient to rescind the alien 's status .

A case is terminated when the respondent is found not removable as DHS charged . U Unrepresented An individual in proceedings may represent himself or herself before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals instead of being represented by an attorney or accredited representative . See Pro Se . V Visa Petition A visa petition is the first step toward obtaining lawful permanent residence for a foreign-born individual or family . It is usually filed by a U.S. citizen , lawful permanent resident , or employer on behalf of an alien . Visa petitions filed by individuals present in the United States are adjudicated by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) and , once approved , may be revoked or revalidated by DHS under certain circumstances . ( Visa petitions filed by individuals outside the United States are adjudicated by the Department of State . ) In some instances , if a visa petition that was filed with USCIS is denied or revoked , or the revalidation of a visa petition is denied , an appeal may be taken to the Board of Immigration Appeals ( BIA ) . For visa petition appeals within the BIA \u2019 s jurisdiction , USCIS is initially responsible for management of the appeal , including the briefing Executive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning , Analysis , and Technology FY 2010 Statistical Year Book Appendix A - Glossary of Terms January 2011 18",

    "text": "process . The BIA \u2019 s role in the appeal process does not begin until the completed record is received from USCIS . Voluntary Departure Voluntary departure is the departure of an alien from the United States without an order of removal . The departure may or may not have been preceded by a hearing before an immigration judge . An alien allowed to voluntarily depart concedes removability but is not barred from seeking admission at a port of entry in the future . Failure to depart within the time granted results in a fine and a 10-year bar against the alien applying for several forms of relief from removal . W Withdrawal of an Appeal An appealing party may , at any time prior to the entry of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals , voluntarily withdraw his or her appeal . The decision made in the case shall be final to the same extent as if no appeal had been taken . Withdrawal of an Application for Relief An alien in proceedings may , at any time prior to a decision in his or her case , voluntarily withdraw any application for relief filed on his or her behalf . Withholding of Removal Pursuant to section 241 ( b ) ( 3 ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act , an alien may not be removed to a particular country if the alien can establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien \u2019 s race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . A request for asylum is deemed to include a request for withholding of removal under the applicable regulations . Withholding-only Proceedings An alien in administrative removal proceedings under section 238 of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( covering aliens who are not lawful permanent residents and have been convicted of an aggravated felony ) and aliens subject to reinstatement of removal under section 241 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act are now able to apply for withholding of removal under section 241 ( b ) ( 3 ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act , as well as under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture , after a screening process by a Department of Homeland Security asylum officer . In a withholding-only proceeding , an immigration judge may only consider the alien \u2019 s application for withholding of removal under section 241 ( b ) ( 3 ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R . sections 1208.16 and 1208.17 . The Board of Immigration Appeals has jurisdiction over appeals from immigration judge decisions in withholding-only cases . See Asylum-only Proceedings .
