    "text": "Immigration Courts : Total Matters Received and Completed An alien charged by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) with a violation of immigration law is issued a charging document . The most common charging documents are the Notice to Appear ( NTA ) and the Notice of Referral to immigration judge . When the charging document is filed by DHS with the immigration court , jurisdiction over the case transfers from DHS to the Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) , which has oversight over the immigration courts located throughout the United States . Once an alien has been ordered removed by EOIR , DHS carries out the removal . EOIR does not maintain statistics on alien removals from the United States . During court proceedings , aliens appear before an immigration judge and either contest or concede the charges against them . In some instances , the immigration judge adjourns the case and sets a continuance date ; for example , the judge may allow the alien time to obtain representation or to file an application for relief . After hearing a case , the immigration judge renders a decision . The immigration judge may order the alien removed , or may grant relief such as cancellation of removal , asylum , adjustment of status , etc . If the immigration judge decides that removability has not been established by DHS , he or she may terminate the proceedings . In addition to proceedings , immigration judges consider other matters such as bonds and motions . \u2022 Bond redetermination hearings are held when an alien in custody seeks release on his or her own recognizance , or seeks a reduction in the amount of bond . In some cases , bond redetermination hearings are held before EOIR receives the charging document from DHS . During bond redetermination hearings , the judge may decide to lower , raise , maintain , or eliminate the bond amount set by DHS , or to change bond conditions . \u2022 Either the alien or DHS may request by motion that a case previously heard by an immigration judge be reopened or reconsidered . Generally , aliens or DHS file motions to reopen or reconsider because of changed circumstances . For the purposes of this Year Book , the term \u201c immigration court matters \u201d includes proceedings ( deportation , exclusion , removal , credible fear , reasonable fear , claimed status , asylum only , rescission , continued detention review , Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act ( NACARA ) , and withholding only ) , bond redeterminations , and motions to reopen or reconsider . Receipts are defined as the total number of proceedings , bond redeterminations , and motions to reopen or reconsider received by the immigration courts during the reporting period . Completions include immigration judge decisions on proceedings , bond redeterminations , motions , and other completions such as administrative closings and changes of venue .

    "text": "Immigration Courts : Proceedings Received and Completed by Type This section of the Statistical Year Book provides further details on proceedings by type . As noted in Tab B , proceedings , motions , and bond redeterminations make up the various types of matters considered by the immigration courts . Until April 1 , 1997 , the two major types of proceedings conducted by immigration courts were exclusion proceedings and deportation proceedings . Individuals charged by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) ( now reorganized under DHS ) as excludable were placed in exclusion proceedings . Exclusion cases generally involved a person who tried to enter the United States , but was stopped at the point of entry because INS found the person to be inadmissible . Deportation cases usually arose when INS alleged that an alien had entered the country illegally , or had entered legally , but then violated one or more conditions of his or her visa . Provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) , which became effective on April 1 , 1997 , established five new types of proceedings : \u2022 Removal Proceedings . Under removal proceedings ( which replaced exclusion and deportation proceedings ) , DHS must file a Notice to Appear ( NTA ) to initiate the proceedings . \u2022 Credible Fear Review . Arriving aliens with no documents or fraudulent documents are subject to expedited removal by DHS . If an arriving alien who is subject to the expedited removal provisions expresses either an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of returning to the country of removal , the alien is referred for a \u201c credible fear \u201d interview by a DHS asylum officer . Aliens found by the asylum officer not to have a credible fear of persecution may request a review by an immigration judge . If the judge determines there is \u201c credible fear , \u201d the judge will vacate the DHS order of expedited removal , and the alien will be placed in removal proceedings . \u2022 Reasonable Fear Review . DHS has the authority to order the administrative removal of certain aggravated felons , and to reinstate orders of removal for aliens previously removed . If an alien who has been ordered administratively removed , or whose prior order of removal has been reinstated expresses a fear of returning to the country of removal , a DHS asylum officer makes a \u201c reasonable fear \u201d determination . Aliens found by the asylum officer not to have a reasonable fear of persecution may request a review by an immigration judge . If the judge determines there is \u201c reasonable fear , \u201d the alien will be placed in withholding only proceedings .

    "text": "\u2022 Claimed Status Review . If an alien in expedited removal proceedings before DHS claims to be a U.S. citizen , to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence , to have been admitted as a refugee , or to have been granted asylum , and DHS determines that the alien has no such claim , he or she can obtain a review of that claim by an immigration judge . \u2022 Asylum-Only . An asylum only case is initiated when an arriving crewman or stowaway is not eligible to apply for admission into the United States , but wants to request asylum . These proceedings also cover Visa Waiver Program beneficiaries and individuals ordered removed from the United States on security grounds . Additional types of proceedings include : \u2022 Rescission . DHS issues a Notice of Intent to Rescind an individual \u2019 s permanent resident status , and the individual has the right to contest the charge before an immigration judge . \u2022 Continued Detention Review . In response to a United States Supreme Court decision in Zadvydas v. Davis , a new type of proceeding was established regarding the continued detention of aliens who are subject to final orders of removal . In these cases the alien has already been ordered removed , but DHS is unable to effect the removal ( e.g. , lack of a travel document , no diplomatic relations with the receiving country , etc. ) . The only issue for the immigration judge to decide in Continued Detention Review cases is whether or not the alien should remain in custody . \u2022 NACARA . Certain aliens may apply for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal under section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act ( NACARA ) . \u2022 Withholding Only . A previous removal/deportation/exclusion order has been reinstated by DHS or the alien has been ordered removed ( administratively ) by DHS ( based upon a conviction for an aggravated felony ) and the alien expresses a fear of persecution or torture if returned to the country of removal and that claim is reviewed by an asylum officer . The asylum officer has concluded that the alien has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture or an immigration judge conducted a Reasonable Fear Review proceeding and found that \u201c reasonable fear of persecution or torture \u201d exists . The immigration judge \u2019 s Reasonable Fear finding automatically initiates a Withholding Only hearing .

    "text": "Immigration Courts : Proceedings Completed by Representation Status The Immigration and Nationality Act states that individuals in removal proceedings before an immigration judge may be represented by counsel , but at no expense to the government . Prior to representing an alien before the immigration court , representatives must file a Notice of Appearance with the court . Many individuals in removal proceedings are indigent and can not afford a private attorney . Some seek free or pro bono representation , while others proceed without counsel on their own , or pro se . Of great concern to EOIR is the large number of individuals appearing pro se . Immigration judges , in order to ensure that such individuals understand the nature of the proceedings , as well as their rights and responsibilities , must take extra care and spend additional time explaining this information . An individual may ask for a continuance of a proceeding to obtain counsel . As shown in Figure 9 , less than half of the aliens whose proceedings were completed during the period FY 2006 \u2013 FY 2010 were represented .

    "text": "Immigration Courts : Disposition of Asylum Cases During removal proceedings an alien may request asylum as relief from removal . The immigration judge must then decide whether to deny or grant an alien \u2019 s application for asylum . If the asylum applicant fails to appear for a scheduled court hearing , the application is considered abandoned . In other instances , the asylum applicant chooses to withdraw his or her application for asylum . EOIR tracks each of these possible outcomes as completed cases : grants , denials , withdrawals , and abandoned applications for asylum . A substantial number of closed cases do not fall into one of the four categories listed above , and are counted as \u201c other \u201d asylum completions , e.g. , change of venue to another court . Further , in some instances , an alien with a pending asylum claim may apply for and be granted another type of relief besides asylum , and this is also recorded as an \u201c other \u201d completion . Figure 16 provides the asylum grant rate for the past five years . The grant rate is calculated as a percentage of asylum claims decided on the merits , i.e. , grants and denials .

    "text": "Immigration Courts : Expedited Asylum Cases There are two ways that aliens may request asylum : \u201c affirmatively , \u201d by completing an asylum application and filing it with a DHS Asylum Office ; or \u201c defensively , \u201d by requesting asylum before an immigration judge . Aliens who file affirmatively with DHS , but whose requests for asylum are not granted , are placed in removal proceedings and referred to the appropriate immigration court for a hearing . Asylum regulations implemented in 1995 called for asylum applications to be processed within 180 days after filing . The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act ( IIRIRA ) of 1996 reiterated that time frame and calls for the administrative adjudication of an asylum application within 180 days of the application filing date , absent exceptional circumstances . This process is time sensitive because the asylum applicant may not apply for employment authorization until 150 days after filing , and DHS then has 30 days to grant or deny employment authorization . The applicant can only be granted employment authorization if the asylum application has not been decided within 180 days of filing , provided there are no delays caused by the alien . Consequently , expedited processing of asylum applications occurs when ( 1 ) an alien files \u201c affirmatively \u201d at a DHS Asylum Office and the application is referred to EOIR within 75 days of filing ; or ( 2 ) an alien files an asylum application \u201c defensively \u201d with EOIR . As shown in Figure 20 below , expedited asylum cases have decreased by 28 percent from FY 2006 to FY 2010 . Total asylum receipts have decreased by 42 percent from FY 2006 to FY 2010 .

    "text": "Immigration Courts : Convention Against Torture In 1999 , the Department of Justice implemented regulations regarding the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( Convention Against Torture or CAT ) . Under these regulations , aliens in removal , deportation , or exclusion proceedings may claim that they \u201c more likely than not \u201d will be tortured if removed from the United States . The regulation provides jurisdiction to the immigration courts to hear these claims , and provides jurisdiction to the BIA to hear appeals from the immigration courts \u2019 decisions regarding CAT claims . There are two forms of protection under the 1999 regulations : \u2022 The regulation established a new form of withholding of removal which is granted to an alien who establishes that he or she would be tortured in the proposed country of removal . \u2022 The second protection concerns aliens who would be tortured in the country of removal , but who are barred from withholding of removal . These aliens may be granted deferral of removal , a form of protection that is more easily and quickly terminated if it becomes possible to remove the alien . As shown in Table 9 below , the immigration courts adjudicated 24,754 CAT applications during FY 2010 . Of those , 489 CAT cases were granted , the majority of which were granted withholding .

Immigration judges also have discretion in certain cases to grant voluntary departure in lieu of removal at the conclusion of proceedings . If the judge finds that the alien has been present in the United States for one year immediately preceding the issuance of the Notice to Appear , has been a person of good moral character for the past five years , is not removable under aggravated felony or terrorist grounds , and has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so , the immigration judge may grant up to 60 days for the alien to depart voluntarily .

Table 15 on page R3 provides information on relief granted under the following provisions . \u2022 Adjustment of Status is a type of relief from deportation , removal , or exclusion , for an alien who is eligible for lawful permanent resident status based on a visa petition approved by DHS . Normally , the visa petition has been filed by a United States citizen spouse . \u2022 Prior to the passage of IIRIRA , Section 212 ( c ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provided relief from deportation for long-term lawful permanent residents who had committed a crime . In order to be eligible to apply for 212 ( c ) relief , an applicant had to show that he or she had been a lawful permanent resident for at least seven years , had served less than five years of a sentence if the underlying crime was classified as an aggravated felony , had been rehabilitated , and had no other criminal record . If an applicant in exclusion or deportation proceedings is able to establish these factors , the immigration judge has discretion to grant relief under 212 ( c ) . \u2022 Suspension of Deportation is another pre-IIRIRA form of discretionary relief . Certain aliens in deportation proceedings who have maintained continuous physical presence in the United States for specific periods of time , and have met the other statutory requirements may be granted suspension of deportation and adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident . The total number of adjustments to lawful permanent resident status under suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal is limited to a 4,000 annual cap under IIRIRA . Applicants for suspension of deportation who applied for this relief prior to the implementation of IIRIRA , or who meet certain conditions of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act ( NACARA ) are not subject to the cap .

    "text": "\u2022 As noted above , Cancellation of Removal is a form of relief provided by IIRIRA . There are two IIRIRA provisions addressing cancellation of removal : \u2022 Permanent Residents . Under the first provision , a lawful permanent resident facing removal on criminal grounds who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for at least five years , and who has resided continuously in the United States for seven years after a lawful admission may request cancellation , provided he or she has no aggravated felony convictions . \u2022 Non-Permanent Residents . Under the second provision , applicants physically present in the United States for a continuous period of 10 years who have not been convicted of a criminal offense may seek cancellation of removal and adjustment of status to permanent resident alien . The applicant must demonstrate exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a citizen or lawful permanent resident alien spouse , parent , or child . IIRIRA limits to 4,000 annually the total number of adjustments to lawful permanent resident status under suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal . Applicants for cancellation of removal who meet certain conditions are not subject to the cap .

The status of an alien may be adjusted by the Attorney General , in his discretion , to that of a lawful permanent resident if a visa petition on behalf of the alien has been approved , an immigrant visa is immediately available at the time of the alien \u2019 s application for adjustment of status , and the alien is not otherwise inadmissible to the United States . Administrative Closure Administrative closure of a case is used to temporarily remove the case from an immigration judge \u2019 s calendar or from the Board of Immigration Appeals \u2019 docket . Administrative closure of a case does not result in a final order . It is merely an administrative convenience which allows the removal of cases from the calendar in appropriate situations . A case may not be administratively closed if opposed by either of the parties . Administrative Law Judges Administrative Law Judges ( ALJs ) in the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer ( OCAHO ) hear cases and adjudicate issues arising under the provisions of the INA relating to : ( 1 ) knowingly hiring , recruiting or referring for a fee unauthorized aliens , or the continued employment of unauthorized aliens and failure to comply with employment eligibility verification requirements in violation of section 274A of the INA ( employer sanctions ) ; ( 2 ) unfair immigration-related employment practices in violation of section 274B of the INA ; ( 3 ) immigration-related document fraud in violation of section 274C of the INA ; and ( 4 ) IRCA \u2019 s prohibition of indemnity bonds .

An asylee can apply to the Department of Homeland Security for lawful permanent resident status under Immigration and Nationality Act section 209 ( b ) after he or she has been physically present in the United States for a period of one year after the date of the asylum grant . Asylum-only Proceedings Certain aliens are not entitled to a removal hearing under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act , yet these aliens are entitled to an asylum-only hearing before an immigration judge . If an alien who is not entitled to a removal hearing under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act requests asylum ( and has not been granted asylum by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , if eligible ) , DHS will file a Form I-863 , Notice of Referral to an Immigration Judge , with the immigration court .

In a bond redetermination hearing , the judge can raise , lower , or maintain the amount of the bond , however , the Immigration and Nationality Act provides that bond of at least $ 1,500 is required before an alien may be released .

See section 240A ( a ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act . Application for this form of discretionary relief is made during the course of a hearing before an immigration judge .

Previously , up to a total of 1,000 refugee admissions and asylum grants were made each fiscal year to applicants who raised claims based on CPC . If applicants for asylum met the criteria for a CPC grant , they were given conditional asylum and were given a final grant of asylum when a number became available . Effective May 11 , 2005 , under the REAL ID Act , the annual cap was lifted on asylum grants based on CPC . See Conditional Asylum Grants .

An alien who was eligible for a grant of asylum based on coercive population control methods received a grant conditioned on an administrative determination by the Department of Homeland Security that a number was available .

Contrast Affirmative Asylum Application . Deferral of Removal If an immigration judge concludes that it is more likely than not that a removable alien will be tortured in a country , but the alien is ineligible for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture ( CAT ) , the alien \u2019 s removal will be deferred . The alien \u2019 s removal is deferred only to the country in which it has been determined that the alien is likely to be tortured . However , the alien may be removed at any time to another country where he or she is not likely to be tortured . In addition , deferral of removal is effective only until it is terminated .

Deportation cases also occurred when INS alleged that a respondent entered the country legally with a visa but then violated one or more conditions of the visa . When INS became aware of a respondent believed to be deportable , they issued a charging document called an Order to Show Cause ( OSC ) . An OSC is the charging document that was used prior to April 1 , 1997 . A deportation proceeding actually began when the OSC was filed with an immigration court . In such proceedings , the government , represented by INS , had to prove that a respondent was deportable for the reasons stated in the OSC . As of April 1 , 1997 , deportation and exclusion proceedings were replaced by removal proceedings . Contrast Exclusion and Removal Proceedings .

In either case , the applicant technically had not entered the country as a matter of law . Beginning April 1 , 1997 , deportation and exclusion proceedings were replaced by removal proceedings . Contrast Deportation and Removal Proceedings . Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) The Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) was created on January 9 , 1983 , through an internal Department of Justice ( DOJ ) reorganization which combined the Board of Immigration Appeals with the immigration judge function , which was previously performed by Special Inquiry Officers of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) ( now Department of Homeland Security ) . The Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer ( OCAHO ) was added in 1987 . EOIR is responsible for adjudicating immigration cases . Specifically , under delegated authority from the Attorney General , EOIR interprets and administers federal immigration laws by conducting immigration court proceedings , appellate reviews , and administrative hearings . EOIR consists of three components : the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge , which is responsible for managing the numerous immigration courts located throughout the United States where immigration judges adjudicate individual cases ; the Board of Immigration Appeals , which primarily conducts appellate reviews of immigration judge decisions ; and the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer , which adjudicates certain immigration-related civil money penalty and document fraud cases . EOIR is committed to providing fair , expeditious , and uniform application of the nation 's immigration laws in all cases . Expedited Asylum Asylum regulations implemented in 1995 mandated that asylum applications be processed within 180 days after filing either at a Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , Asylum Office or at an immigration court . The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) reiterated the 180-day rule . Consequently , expedited processing of asylum applications occurs when ( 1 ) an alien files \u201c affirmatively \u201d at an Asylum Office on or after January 4 , 1995 , and the application is referred to the Executive Office for Immigration Review ( EOIR ) by DHS within 75 days of the filing ; or ( 2 ) an alien files an application \u201c defensively \u201d with EOIR on or after January 4 , 1995 .

Immigration and Nationality Act The Immigration and Nationality Act consolidated previous immigration laws into one coordinated statute . As amended , the Immigration and Nationality Act provides the foundation for immigration law in effect today . The Immigration and Nationality Act deals with the immigration , temporary admission , naturalization , and removal of aliens . Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) Until its transition to the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) on March 1 , 2003 , INS was the agency responsible for administering immigration and nationality laws relating to the temporary admission , immigration , naturalization , and removal of aliens . Specifically , INS inspected aliens to determine their admissibility into the United States , adjudicated requests of aliens for benefits under the law , guarded against illegal entry into the United States , removed aliens in this country who were in violation of the law , examined alien applicants seeking to become citizens , and enforced immigration-related employment verification and document fraud laws . See Department of Homeland Security . Immigration Court Each immigration court is staffed with one or more immigration judges who conduct immigration hearings . An administrative control immigration court is one that creates and maintains Records of Proceedings for immigration courts within an assigned geographical area . Management functions of the immigration court are supervised by a Court Administrator . Immigration Judge The term immigration judge means an attorney whom the Attorney General appoints as an administrative judge within the Executive Office for Immigration Review , Office of the Chief Immigration Judge , qualified to conduct specified classes of proceedings , including exclusion , deportation , removal , asylum , bond redetermination , rescission , withholding , credible fear , reasonable fear , and claimed status review . Immigration judges act as the Attorney General \u2019 s delegates in deciding the matters before them and exercise the powers and duties delegated to them by the Immigration and Nationality Act and by the Attorney General through regulation . Immigration judge decisions are administratively final unless appealed or certified to the Board of Immigration Appeals . Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ( IRCA ) Among other things , IRCA addressed the problem of undocumented aliens by imposing sanctions on employers who hired or continued to employ them , and legalizing the status of certain undocumented entrants who had arrived prior to January 1 , 1982 .

An immigration judge shall order removed in absentia any alien who , after written notice of the time and place of proceedings and the consequences of failing to appear , fails to appear at his or her removal proceeding . The DHS must establish by clear , unequivocal , and convincing evidence that the written notice was provided and that the alien is removable . See Failure to Appear . Inadmissible The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) replaced the term \u201c excludable \u201d with the term \u201c inadmissible. \u201d Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act defines classes of aliens ineligible to receive visas and ineligible for admission . Aliens who , at the time of entry , are within one of these classes of inadmissible aliens are removable . Institutional Hearing Program ( IHP ) The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 requires the Attorney General to expeditiously commence immigration proceedings for alien inmates convicted of crimes in the United States . To meet this requirement , the Department of Justice established the IHP where removal hearings are held inside correctional institutions prior to the alien completing his or her criminal sentence . The IHP is a collaborative effort between the Executive Office for Immigration Review and the Department of Homeland Security and various federal , state , and local corrections agencies throughout the country .

Additionally , some aliens are determined to be removable by the Department of Homeland Security , e.g. , in expedited removal or administrative removal proceedings . Only aliens found removable by the Executive Office for Immigration Review are reported in this Year Book . Removal Proceedings An immigration court proceeding begun on or after April 1 , 1997 , seeking to either stop certain aliens from being admitted to the United States or to remove them from the United States . A removal case usually arises when the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) alleges that a respondent is inadmissible to the United States , has entered the country illegally by crossing the border without being inspected by an immigration officer , or has violated the terms of his or her admission . The DHS issues a charging document called a Notice to Appear ( Form I-862 ) and files it with an immigration court to begin a removal proceeding . Reopen , Motion to Aliens may request , by motion , the reopening of a case previously heard by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals ( BIA ) . A motion to reopen asks an immigration judge or the BIA to consider new and previously unavailable facts or evidence in a case . Represented A represented individual has an attorney or accredited representative act as his agent in proceedings before the immigration courts or the Board of Immigration Appeals . Rescission Proceedings A less common type of proceeding is related to rescinding lawful permanent resident status . If , within five years of granting adjustment of status , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) discovers that the respondent/applicant was not entitled to lawful permanent resident ( LPR ) status when it was granted , DHS issues a Notice of Intent to Rescind . If the respondent/applicant requests a hearing before an immigration court , DHS will file the Notice with the immigration court , and the proceeding to rescind the individual 's LPR status commences . As with deportation cases , the government has the burden of proof to show that rescission is warranted . If an individual loses LPR status , he or she then is usually subject to removal proceedings . Although rescission proceedings still exist after April 1 , 1997 , DHS may also place an LPR into removal proceedings . An order of removal is sufficient to rescind the alien 's status . See Notice of Intent to Rescind . Respondent A party to an immigration proceeding against whom charges have been lodged and findings may be made .

See former section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act . Application for this relief was made during the course of a hearing before an immigration judge . The status of an alien who was granted this relief was adjusted to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence . In 1997 , the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 replaced suspension of deportation with cancellation of removal . See Cancellation of Removal , Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( IIRIRA ) . T Termination A termination is a type of completion in which a case is closed by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals without a final order of removal or deportation . A case is terminated when the respondent is found not removable as DHS charged . U Unrepresented An individual in proceedings may represent himself or herself before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals instead of being represented by an attorney or accredited representative . See Pro Se . V Visa Petition A visa petition is the first step toward obtaining lawful permanent residence for a foreign-born individual or family . It is usually filed by a U.S. citizen , lawful permanent resident , or employer on behalf of an alien . Visa petitions filed by individuals present in the United States are adjudicated by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) and , once approved , may be revoked or revalidated by DHS under certain circumstances . ( Visa petitions filed by individuals outside the United States are adjudicated by the Department of State . ) In some instances , if a visa petition that was filed with USCIS is denied or revoked , or the revalidation of a visa petition is denied , an appeal may be taken to the Board of Immigration Appeals ( BIA ) . For visa petition appeals within the BIA \u2019 s jurisdiction , USCIS is initially responsible for management of the appeal , including the briefing Executive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning , Analysis , and Technology FY 2010 Statistical Year Book Appendix A - Glossary of Terms January 2011 18",

Voluntary Departure Voluntary departure is the departure of an alien from the United States without an order of removal . The departure may or may not have been preceded by a hearing before an immigration judge . An alien allowed to voluntarily depart concedes removability but is not barred from seeking admission at a port of entry in the future . Failure to depart within the time granted results in a fine and a 10-year bar against the alien applying for several forms of relief from removal . W Withdrawal of an Appeal An appealing party may , at any time prior to the entry of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals , voluntarily withdraw his or her appeal . The decision made in the case shall be final to the same extent as if no appeal had been taken . Withdrawal of an Application for Relief An alien in proceedings may , at any time prior to a decision in his or her case , voluntarily withdraw any application for relief filed on his or her behalf . Withholding of Removal Pursuant to section 241 ( b ) ( 3 ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act , an alien may not be removed to a particular country if the alien can establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien \u2019 s race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion .

In a withholding-only proceeding , an immigration judge may only consider the alien \u2019 s application for withholding of removal under section 241 ( b ) ( 3 ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R . sections 1208.16 and 1208.17 .
